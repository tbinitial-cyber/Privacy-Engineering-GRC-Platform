## 1. Executive Summary & Archetype Profile

Freshworks operates as a primary representative of the **Indian-Founded Global SaaS (Freshdesk, Freshservice)** archetype. In enterprise Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM), reviewing a vendor of this scale requires balancing their non-negotiable standardized security exhibits against customer statutory liability under GDPR, Indian DPDPA, and American privacy law.

## 2. The 10-Point Battleground Contract Dissection

### Battleground 1: Role of the Parties (Processor vs. Controller)
* **Contractual Position:** Processor for Service Data; Controller for Account, Billing, and Aggregated Product Usage Analytics.
* **Statutory Compliance:** Aligns with GDPR Article 28(1) and DPDPA Section 8(2) for primary customer processing.
* **TPRM Risk Assessment:** Look out for broad definitions of "Service-Generated Data" or "Diagnostic Telemetry", where the vendor claims independent controller ownership.

---

### Battleground 2: Purpose Limitation & Artificial Intelligence Model Training
* **Contractual Position:** Freddy AI: Customer ticket and service data is processed using tenant isolation; data is NOT pooled across customers to train foundation models.
* **Legal Analysis:** Fulfills the strict mandate of GDPR Article 28(3)(a) (processing solely on documented instructions).
* **Enterprise Redline Rule:** Always ensure the DPA explicitly prohibits the vendor from using customer workspace data, API prompts, or telemetric interactions to train public or foundation AI models.

---

### Battleground 3: Subprocessor Engagement, Notice & Right to Object
* **Contractual Position:** 30 Days advance notice via Freshworks Subprocessor RSS subscription page.
* **Regulatory Standard:** GDPR Article 28(2) requires prior specific or general written authorization.
* **TPRM Finding:** The industry gold standard is **30 calendar days** prior notice via an automated RSS or email subscription list, coupled with a guaranteed right to terminate without penalty if objections cannot be resolved.

---

### Battleground 4: Data Subject Rights Assistance (DSAR SLA)
* **Contractual Position:** Built-in GDPR & DPDPA compliant 'Forget User' APIs and admin interfaces for immediate ticket redaction.
* **Statutory Standard:** GDPR Article 28(3)(e) and DPDPA Section 11–12.
* **Operational Reality:** Hyperscalers and large SaaS providers build self-service administrative tools rather than manually fulfilling individual end-user DSARs.

---

### Battleground 5: Personal Data Breach Notification SLA
* **Contractual Position:** Without undue delay, targeting 48 hours for incident notification to customer primary contact.
* **Statutory Mandate:** GDPR Article 33 gives the Controller only **72 hours** to notify European DPAs.
* **Negotiation Advice:** Always attempt to redline vague "undue delay" language into a rigid **48-hour SLA** so your DPO has at least 24 hours to compile the regulatory notification.

---

### Battleground 6: International Cross-Border Transfers & Safeguards
* **Contractual Position:** Tri-jurisdictional: EU SCCs (Module 2), UK IDTA, compliance with Indian DPDPA Section 16 cross-border standards.
* **Statutory Mechanism:** GDPR Chapter V (Articles 44–46), EU Standard Contractual Clauses (2021/914 Module 2), and Indian DPDPA Section 16 standards.
* **Schrems II Compliance:** Ensure the vendor provides supplementary technical measures (end-to-end encryption in transit and at rest).

---

### Battleground 7: Audit Rights & SOC 2 Certification Verification
* **Contractual Position:** SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, ISO 27701 reports provided annually via Freshworks Security Trust Center.
* **Statutory Standard:** GDPR Article 28(3)(h).
* **Enterprise Practice:** Large tech providers do not allow physical walk-throughs of their data centers due to multi-tenant security risks. Instead, they provide annually audited **SOC 2 Type II** and **ISO 27001** reports, which satisfies Article 28(3)(h).

---

### Battleground 8: Limitation of Liability & Regulatory Fine Indemnification
* **Contractual Position:** Standard 12 months fees paid cap, with negotiable Super-Caps for enterprise Fortune 500 contracts.
* **The #1 Commercial Battleground:** Standard Master Services Agreements cap vendor liability at 12 months fees paid. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Enterprise customers must fight for a **2x–5x Super-Cap** for data protection breaches, particularly given potential penalties under GDPR (€20M / 4%) and DPDPA 2023 (₹250 Crore).

---

### Battleground 9: Government Access Requests & Surveillance Challenges
* **Contractual Position:** Commits to notify customer unless prohibited by law; standard legal process required.
* **The US CLOUD Act / FISA Shield:** Evaluates whether the vendor will contest unlawful government subpoenas in court and notify the customer before disclosing records.

---

### Battleground 10: Data Return, Deletion & Certified Destruction
* **Contractual Position:** Service data retained for 14 days post-termination for recovery; permanently purged within 30 to 60 days.
* **Statutory Standard:** GDPR Article 28(3)(g) and DPDPA Section 8(7).
* **Standard Verification:** Requires verified hardware media sanitization under **NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1** or DoD standards upon contract termination.

## 3. High-Value Interview Defense Script

When asked in an interview: *"How do you evaluate vendor contracts and DPAs in TPRM?"*, use this analysis:

> *"In my vendor risk assessments, I evaluate vendor DPAs against a rigid 10-point battleground matrix. For instance, when reviewing Freshworks, I confirm that customer data is strictly isolated from foundation AI training under Battleground 2. Furthermore, I review their subprocessor notification SLA under Battleground 3—confirming whether they give at least 30 days prior notice—and ensure their breach notification aligns with our statutory 72-hour reporting window under GDPR Article 33."*
